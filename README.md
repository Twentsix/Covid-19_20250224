# Covid-19_20250224
Welcome! This project is intended to explore and analyze a data from public dataset, in this case Covid-19 data from WHO. Another goal of this project is to explore and train my skills in data analytics world through Python. I aspire to become a data scientist. In this project, I have 2 files; one is Jupyter Notebook and the other one is Tableau's link. For the notebook, you can find my analysis about the dataset of Covid-19 from WHO that were publicly accessible with latest data is August 18, 2024. For the link, it is more to visualize and make dashboard out of it with the same element like the notebook has. Thank you!
